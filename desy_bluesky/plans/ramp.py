    Perform a ramping motion of a positioner while periodically reading detectors.

    This plan moves a positioner (e.g., a motor) to a specified setpoint while
    simultaneously triggering and reading a list of detectors at regular intervals.
    Metadata about the plan, positioner, and detectors is recorded.

    Parameters:
        positioner (Movable): The positioner (e.g., motor) to be moved.
        readables (list[Readable]): A list of readable devices (e.g., detectors) to be triggered and read.
        setpoint (float): The target position for the positioner.
        sample_period (float): The time interval (in seconds) between successive readings of the detectors.
        md (dict[str, Any] | None, optional): Additional metadata to include in the run. Defaults to None.

    Yields:
        Msg: Bluesky messages for controlling the RunEngine.
